# Introduction

+ Front End
+ Back End
+ Ops

+ Programming Language Theory (lite)

+ Startups?

+ Advice on learning

---

# The Command Line 

## Grammar and Syntax

```bash
verb -adjective -adjective noun noun
```

Adjectives are typically optional

First noun is generally the source of a command
Second noun is usually the target of a command

Sometimes you only use verbs, or one noun, it varies.

---

# The Command Line 

## Basic


```bash
cd /absolute/path/you/want 
cd relative/path/you/want
```
-- change directory  

```bash
ls
ls path/you/want
```
-- look stuff?

```bash
man cd
man ls
```
-- manual / help

```bash
pwd
```
-- present working directory

---

# The Command Line 

## Basic II

```bash
mkdir new_folder
mkdir much_cooler_name_than_new_folder
```
-- make directory
```bash
rm stupid_file_i_dont_need_anymore 
```
-- remove something
```bash
wc
```
-- word count 
```bash
head
```
-- print first bit of something 

---

# The Command Line 

## Basic III

```bash
tail
```
-- print last bit of something 

```bash
cp
```
-- copy something 

```bash
mv
```
-- move something 

---
# The Command Line
## Intermediate

```bash
grep -r 'text you need  to find' .
```
-- search for text

The pipe operator 
```bash
|
```
allows you to chain commands together, to pipe the output of one command to another

```bash
ls file_location | wc -l
grep -r '2015-08-24' . | head
```

```bash
sudo mdkir /some/root/level/permissions/directory
sudo su
```
-- run as a command as super user or become super user

---

# Version Control 

Workflow
```bash
git pull
```
Get most up to date version of the code
Then make changes to the code that you want to 

```bash
git status
git add .
git commit
git push
```

Submit Pull Request
Tag your reviewer with @their_github_handle

---
# Interactive Session I

+ Make a directory in your user home /Users/[your_username] called workspace or something similar
+ cd into this directory
+ use pwd to output the location you're in

+ use git clone to clone a fork of the l2c repository into this location
+ edit the roster.txt file to include your name
+ check the git status
+ add these changes
+ commit these changes
+ push these changes

+ submit a pull request

+ help others when you're done and your PR has been merged

---
# Interactive Session I

Answer these questions programatically:

How many lines (presumably each line is a person) are in the roster.txt file?

What are the names of all the people who have an 'n' in their name in the roster.txt file?

Does the python directory make use of a libarary called pandas?


---
# Language of the Internet 
## JSON (Javascript Object Notation)

```json
  {
  "name" : "Nathan",
  "age"  : 33,
  "favorite_color" : "blue, no green...ahhhhh"
  }
```

Or more generically:
```json
  {
  "key" : "value",
  "key2"  : "value2"
  }
```

---
# Language of the Internet 
## JSON - default data structure of the internet 

Also supports deep nested structures:

```json
  {
  "league" : "NFL",
  "team"  : "Broncos",
  "roster" : {
              "QB" : [ "Peyton Manning", "Some other guy"],
              "WR" : [ "Rod Smith", "Erik Decker", "Ed Macafree"] 
              },
  "ranking": 7
  }
```
---
# Language of the Internet 
## RESTful API (Application Programming Interface)

Base URL
```http
http://www.khanacademy.org/api/v1/
```
+
endpoint
```http
exercises
```
makes up and api call

```http
http://www.khanacademy.org/api/v1/exercises
```

save to a file with 
```bash
curl http://www.khanacademy.org/api/v1/exercises > exercises.json
```

Also can paste url in a browser

---
# Language of the Internet 
## HTTP codes

+ 200s - Yay everything is good, successful call 
+ 400s - Something went wrong:
  + 403: Forbidden
  + 404: Not Found
+ 500s - Something went really really wrong (but in a different way), the server did not respond


---
# Language of the Internet

Another useful tool - wget
Downloads data at urls
```bash
wget url/you/want/to/download
```

---
# Interactive Session II
Make a couple curl request to an endpoing with an additional -v option
+ make one that you know should succeed and confirm that you got a 200 response
+ make one that you know should fail and see what sort of response you get

Use wget to download a website and then insepct the contents of the file
+ Open Chrome
+ Right Click, inspect element
+ be blown away by what the web looks like
+ click on console
+ you can run javascript here

```javascript
var x = {"fruit" : "tomato", "vegetable" : "asparagus"}
```
you can derefence the object with
```javascript
x.fruit
x["fruit"]
```

# Jira / Scrum / Agile 

Project Management

+ Tradeoffs

+ Vocabulary

# Intro to Python 

+ a python file ends with a .py extension

it can be run from the command line
```bash
python some_python_file.py
```

you can also load python files into ipython with
```python
%load some_python_file.py
```

ipython is a repl (Read, Eval, Print, Loop) where you can interactively write code

---

# Intro to Python 

assign variables like this:
```python
x = 12
```
print them to the screen:
```python
print x
```
or print other things as well:
```python
print this is a super important message
```
---

# Interactive Session III

+ write a python script that prints something to the screen
+ run it from the command line

+ load ipython ( or just the standard python interpreter if you haven't downloaded it yet)
+ make a variable
+ reassign that variable to something else
+ print out the variable

---

# Intro to Python 

## What is a Function?

Declare a function in python:
```python
def function_name(arg1, arg2):
    # do really interesting or possibly quite boring things with args
    # find a final result
    return result
```

Example:
```python
def add_1(n):
    return n+1
```

## **a note about whitespace and indentation**

---

# Python Data Structures 

+ lists
+ dictionarys (dicts) 


---

# Interactive Session IV

+ Grab a ticket in Jira (from the intro epic) 
+ assign it to yourself
+ move the ticket to in progress
+ write code that completes the acceptance criteria
+ commit your code, submit a PR, get someone to review your code
+ once your code is merged, move the ticket to done
